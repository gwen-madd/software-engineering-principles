# software-engineering-principles
Your one stop shop for everything I know about Software Engineering as a science and a profession

## What is this?
This is meant to be a collection of descriptions around data structures, algorithms, implementations, opinions on software design tradeoffs, my experiences in industry and more. That is not an exhaustive list and I will add specificity as I add content (hopefully)

## Why am I doing this?
I will use this repo to prove to you I know everything you would expect a senior software engineer to know. And if I haven't handled an edge case for you or your company's edge case yet, submit an issue and we'll open a discussion.

I am making myself an accessibility tool. This will serve as a way to brush up my skillset in a technically demanding field. I'm also doing this because I hope it will help others understand these same concepts. I value information dissemination. I won't claim to be a teacher, not by any means. But I do hope my ramblings help at least one person understand one of these concepts a bit better. We're all in this together, after all.

## How is this structured?
This is a work in progress. I'm stream of consciousness adding this section as we speak. I thought about it for a little while and I'd like to build up data structures in Go and Java also. Just like what I did way back in college. So I suppose we'll start with Go and Java data primitives and go from there.
